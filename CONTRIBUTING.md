# CONTRIBUTING

### info:
- to get an idea on what work is being done right now (to either not interfer or to contribute) refer [this file](./CURRENT_WORK.md)


### what to contribute / what not
- As the project is still very early on in development, It does not make much sense to contribute actual content changes (if youw ant to regardless, please dm me on discord and tell me what you'Re planing to do so I can validate if that fits the development path before you go ahead and write a bunch of code)

- I would appreciate any support with formatting / testing code so feel free to check for bad code and things that do not really change the actual content but rather the code syntax and backend

- PR's for fixing typos are also welcome (typo correction PR's can be directly merged to the main branch)

- check how to contribute below to see what branches you can contribute to

### how to contribute
- 1. fork this repository
- 2. make changes in main branch and commit them to your fork
- 3. merge your main branch to this repo's 'fixes' branch (unless it's only typo correction)
- 4. get your name added on the contributor list üòâ
- 5. üöÄ continue creating together
